##  Key Insights

- Customers on **month-to-month contracts** have significantly higher churn rates.
- **Electronic check** users are more likely to churn than those using other payment methods.
- The churn rate is highest among customers with **0–12 months** of tenure.
- Both **males and females** show similar churn behavior.
- Long-term contracts (1 or 2 years) correlate with **lower churn rates**.

##  Recommendations

- **Offer incentives to month-to-month users:**  
  Customers on month-to-month plans show the highest churn. Offer discounts or loyalty rewards to shift them to longer-term contracts.

- **Use email campaigns for better customer understanding:**  
  Churn is highest in the first 12 months. Deploy onboarding emails and early engagement campaigns to build trust and improve retention.

- **Use targeted surveys for electronic check users:**  
  57.3% of churned users pay via electronic check. Gather feedback through surveys and encourage switching to more secure, automated payment methods.

- **Promote long-term plans more aggressively:**  
  Churn is significantly lower among 1- and 2-year contract users. Highlight these plans during sign-up with added benefits or pricing advantages.
